//Destructuring simply implies breaking down a complex structure into simpler parts.
// In JavaScript, this complex structure is usually an object or an array. 
//With the destructuring syntax, you can extract smaller fragments from arrays and objects.
// Destructuring syntax can be used for variable declaration or variable assignment.
